                After completing my Master's Degree in Applied Linguistics in
                2015, I immigrated to Turkey, Istanbul and started my
                professional journey as an elementary school teacher. Throughout
                my teaching career, I encountered a recurring challenge: the
                availability of teaching materials and worksheets.

                One day in 2017, I had a brilliant idea: transforming all my
                teaching materials into interactive electronic versions. Eager
                to explore the concept, I sought guidance from a friend, who
                provided me with a foundational understanding of creating simple
                static HTML and CSS pages. Over time, I delved deeper into web
                development, honing my skills independently. By the end of my
                teaching career in 2021, I had transitioned into a full-stack
                developer, albeit with limited experience and a beginner's
                perspective.

                In 2022, my wife and I immigrated to Canada, Ottawa. This is
                where I embarked on a fresh journey in the field of Web
                Development and Internet Applications. So far, I have learned
                many new skills and have completed numerous project. Here is a
                glimpse...
