                After completing my Master's Degree in Applied Linguistics in
                2015, I immigrated to Turkey, Istanbul and started my
                professional journey as an elementary school teacher. Throughout
                my teaching career, I encountered a recurring challenge: the
                availability of teaching materials and worksheets. Often, the
                school's aging, black and white printer would malfunction, or
                there would be a backlog of teachers awaiting their turn to
                print.

                One morning in 2017, I had a brilliant idea: transforming all my
                teaching materials into interactive electronic versions. Eager
                to explore the concept, I sought guidance from the coding
                teacher at school, who provided me with a foundational
                understanding of creating simple static HTML and CSS pages. Over
                time, I delved deeper into web development, honing my skills
                independently. By the end of my teaching career in 2021, I had
                transitioned into a full-stack developer, albeit with limited
                experience and a beginner's perspective.

                In 2022, my wife and I were granted permanent residency in
                Canada and moved to Ottawa where we have decided to spend our
                lives together for the foreseeable future. Initially, my plan
                was to complete a brief college program to obtain my teaching
                certificate and continue teaching in Canada. Yet, again, another
                brilliant idea hit me: What if I embarked on a fresh journey in
                a field I held in high regard, parallel to my passion for
                teaching? Could I successfully navigate this transition? Could I
                possibly succeed?
